PROBLEM STATEMENT: LAVASA WEB PORTAL DEVELOPMENT

Introduction:
Lavasa, a burgeoning urban development project, envisions a comprehensive web portal to enhance user engagement and provide valuable information about its various facets. The web portal comprises three primary sections: Home, Shops, and Developers. Each section serves a distinct purpose and contributes to the overall user experience.

OBJECTIVE: 

Home Section:
Display an enticing image that captures the essence of Lavasa.
Present an interactive map showcasing the region's shops and stores.
Implement a hover-over feature on shops, triggering an info box with essential details (name, number, and rating).
Shops Section:
Develop individual webpages for each shop or store with comprehensive analysis.
Developers Section:
Showcase a list of names of all developers involved in the Lavasa project.

Purpose:
The Lavasa Web Portal aims to create a centralized online platform that enhances user interaction.
The portal will serve as a comprehensive resource for residents and visitors, offering insights into the region's shops, stores, and the individuals contributing to the project's development.


How To use:
The Lavasa web page features an interactive map displaying all shops. Hovering over a shop reveals its specific rating, providing users with real-time insights. This dynamic feature enhances the user experience, allowing for seamless exploration and quick access to valuable information about each shop in Lavasa.
